# We load a dataset using Pandas library, and apply the following algorithms, and find the best one for this specific dataset by accuracy evaluation methods.
# 
# Let's first load required libraries:
# 

# In[38]:


import itertools
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.ticker import NullFormatter
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.ticker as ticker
from sklearn import preprocessing

# ### About dataset
# 

# This dataset is about past loans. The **Loan_train.csv** data set includes details of 346 customers whose loan are already paid off or defaulted. It includes following fields:
# 
# | Field          | Description                                                                           |
# | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
# | Loan_status    | Whether a loan is paid off on in collection                                           |
# | Principal      | Basic principal loan amount at the                                                    |
# | Terms          | Origination terms which can be weekly (7 days), biweekly, and monthly payoff schedule |
# | Effective_date | When the loan got originated and took effects                                         |
# | Due_date       | Since it’s one-time payoff schedule, each loan has one single due date                |
# | Age            | Age of applicant                                                                      |
# | Education      | Education of applicant                                                                |
# | Gender         | The gender of applicant                                                               |
# 

# Let's download the dataset
# 

# In[39]:


get_ipython().system('wget -O loan_train.csv https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-ML0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/FinalModule_Coursera/data/loan_train.csv')


# ### Load Data From CSV File
# 

# In[40]:


df = pd.read_csv('loan_train.csv')
df.head()
df.to_csv('loan_train.csv')


# In[41]:


df.shape


# ### Convert to date time object
# 

# In[42]:


df['due_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['due_date'])
df['effective_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['effective_date'])
df.head()


# # Data visualization and pre-processing
# 

# Let’s see how many of each class is in our data set
# 

# In[43]:


df['loan_status'].value_counts()


# 260 people have paid off the loan on time while 86 have gone into collection
# 

# Let's plot some columns to underestand data better:
# 

# In[44]:


# notice: installing seaborn might takes a few minutes
get_ipython().system('conda install -c anaconda seaborn -y')


# In[45]:


import seaborn as sns

bins = np.linspace(df.Principal.min(), df.Principal.max(), 10)
g = sns.FacetGrid(df, col="Gender", hue="loan_status", palette="Set1", col_wrap=2)
g.map(plt.hist, 'Principal', bins=bins, ec="k")

g.axes[-1].legend()
plt.show()


# In[46]:


bins = np.linspace(df.age.min(), df.age.max(), 10)
g = sns.FacetGrid(df, col="Gender", hue="loan_status", palette="Set1", col_wrap=2)
g.map(plt.hist, 'age', bins=bins, ec="k")

g.axes[-1].legend()
plt.show()


# # Pre-processing:  Feature selection/extraction
# 

# ### Let's look at the day of the week people get the loan
# 

# In[47]:


df['dayofweek'] = df['effective_date'].dt.dayofweek
bins = np.linspace(df.dayofweek.min(), df.dayofweek.max(), 10)
g = sns.FacetGrid(df, col="Gender", hue="loan_status", palette="Set1", col_wrap=2)
g.map(plt.hist, 'dayofweek', bins=bins, ec="k")
g.axes[-1].legend()
plt.show()


# We see that people who get the loan at the end of the week don't pay it off, so let's use Feature binarization to set a threshold value less than day 4
# 

# In[48]:


df['weekend'] = df['dayofweek'].apply(lambda x: 1 if (x>3)  else 0)
df.head()


# ## Convert Categorical features to numerical values
# 

# Let's look at gender:
# 

# In[49]:


df.groupby(['Gender'])['loan_status'].value_counts(normalize=True)


# 86 % of female pay there loans while only 73 % of males pay there loan
# 

# Let's convert male to 0 and female to 1:
# 

# In[50]:


df['Gender'].replace(to_replace=['male','female'], value=[0,1],inplace=True)
df.head()


# ## One Hot Encoding
# 
# #### How about education?
# 

# In[51]:


df.groupby(['education'])['loan_status'].value_counts(normalize=True)


# #### Features before One Hot Encoding
# 

# In[52]:


df[['Principal','terms','age','Gender','education']].head()


# #### Use one hot encoding technique to conver categorical varables to binary variables and append them to the feature Data Frame
# 

# In[53]:


Feature = df[['Principal','terms','age','Gender','weekend']]
Feature.head()


# In[54]:


Feature = pd.concat([Feature,pd.get_dummies(df['education'])], axis=1)
Feature.head()


# In[55]:


Feature.drop(['Master or Above'], axis = 1,inplace=True)
Feature.head()


# In[ ]:





# ### Feature Selection
# 

# Let's define feature sets, X:
# 

# In[66]:


X = Feature
X[0:5]


# What are our lables?
# 

# In[67]:


y = df['loan_status'].values


# ## Normalize Data
# 

# Data Standardization give data zero mean and unit variance (technically should be done after train test split)
# 

# In[68]:


X= preprocessing.StandardScaler().fit(X).transform(X)
X[0:5]


# # Converting Descriptive categories to binary

# In[69]:


#  y['loan_status']= y['loan_status'].apply(lambda x : 1 if (x=='PAIDOFF') else 0)
for i in range(len(y)):
    if(y[i]=='PAIDOFF'):
        y[i]=1
    else:
        y[i]=0


# ## Train_Test_Split

# In[71]:


from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split as split

train_x, test_x, train_y, test_y = split(X,y, test_size=0.3, random_state=1)

# # Classification
# 

# Now, it is your turn, use the training set to build an accurate model. Then use the test set to report the accuracy of the model
# You should use the following algorithm:
# 
# *   K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
# *   Decision Tree
# *   Support Vector Machine
# *   Logistic Regression
# 
# \__ Notice:\__
# 
# *   You can go above and change the pre-processing, feature selection, feature-extraction, and so on, to make a better model.
# *   You should use either scikit-learn, Scipy or Numpy libraries for developing the classification algorithms.
# *   You should include the code of the algorithm in the following cells.
# 

# # K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
# 
# Notice: You should find the best k to build the model with the best accuracy.\
# **warning:** You should not use the **loan_test.csv** for finding the best k, however, you can split your train_loan.csv into train and test to find the best **k**.
#

from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn import metrics


# In[76]:


ks =20
mean_acc = np.zeros((ks-1))
for n in range(1, ks):
    neigh = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors= n)
    neigh.fit(train_x, train_y)
